## How it Works
The Golden Coup mt5 utilizes the MetaTrader 5 platform and requires the Trade and Indicators libraries to function properly. It operates based on the OnTick function, which is triggered every time a new tick is received.

Upon initialization, the program sets a timer to trigger the OnTick function every minute. This ensures that market conditions are continuously analyzed and trades are executed in a timely manner.

The AnalyzeMarket function is responsible for analyzing the market conditions. It retrieves the current and previous prices of the selected symbol, as well as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Based on these values, it determines whether a buy or sell opportunity exists.

The ExecuteTrade function is called when a buy or sell opportunity is identified. It calculates the lot size based on the account balance and risk management parameters. It then opens a trade using the Trade.Buy or Trade.Sell function, depending on the type of opportunity.

The program runs continuously until it is stopped. The OnDeinit function is responsible for terminating the program by stopping the timer.
